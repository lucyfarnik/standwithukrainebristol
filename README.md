# Stand With Ukraine - Bristol
I made this website shortly after Russia's invasion into Ukraine
on 24 February 2022 after speaking to my friends and finding out
many of them had no clue what was going on, why they should care,
or what they could possibly do to help something so far away.

After some innitial successes with social media messaging and speaking
with several people from Ukraine about the idea, I decided to create
a central information hub for everyone in Bristol to learn about the
crisis and what they can do to help. We also used it to promote
a protest we organized on 19 March - about 3 weeks after the war
started since we wanted the politicians to know people still care
about this.

The website is made with React and Tailwind, and uses Vite as its
build tool.

It includes videos from previous protests in Bristol, along with a
timeline of events using the excellent [Vertical Timeline component
by St√©phane Monnot](https://github.com/stephane-monnot/react-vertical-timeline).

That said, if your cause can be reasonably supported by a sensible
left-wing activist, I will almost certainly give you permission to
use my code to promote it.
